This is me practicing creating Linux Kernel modules. I have integated an old project of mine into kernel module. Serves as a non-cryptographic PRNG.
Nothing to interesting.
Practice makes perfect (especially with this stuff).

The goal is to be able to create a project with a kernel module that will be a SSL/TLS session key extraction via SSL_connect kernel hooking. (without crashin the system evert five minutes).
